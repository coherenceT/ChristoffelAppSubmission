Code Implementation:
Loop and Array for "Add to Filter" Screen: I implemented a loop and an array to manage the addition and removal of dishes. This feature allows the chef to dynamically add meals to the menu, and the user can filter and choose meals based on their preferences.
Payment Flow: The app allows users to pay directly from the Starter, Dessert, and Main screens, streamlining the payment process.
Custom Dish Creation: Users have the ability to create a custom dish, where they can adjust the ingredients and meal options based on their preferences.
State Management: I used state management techniques to ensure smooth handling of meal selections and customizations, allowing users to see real-time updates on their order and payment screen.
